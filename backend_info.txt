- CORS middleware is enabled to allow frontend applications to access the API
- The server maintains the current DataFrame in memory (in production, you should use a proper database)
- All endpoints include proper error handling
- The /generate-response endpoint uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses
- The visualization endpoint returns Plotly plots as JSON that can be rendered on the frontend
- To test the API, you can use the following sequence:
- Upload a dataset using the /upload-data endpoint
- Generate a summary using /generate-summary
- Get visualizations using /visualize-data
- Ask questions about the data using /generate-response
